# Git Commit Guidelines

## Initial Assessment
Have a look at Git diff. Think about how to batch the changes into commits:
- If you have been instructed to make the commits, then do so, one at a time.
- If not, then just suggest what the batches would be.

## Commit Best Practices

### Don't ever do anything destructive

ABOVE ALL, don't do anything that could result in lost work or mess up yet-to-be-committed changes, unless EXPLICITLY instructed to by the user after warning them.


### Batching changes into commits
- Each commit should represent a small/medium feature, or stage, or cluster of related changes (e.g. tweaking a bunch of docs).
- The codebase should (ideally) be in a working state after each commit
- Try not to mix unrelated changes

### Commit Message Format
```
<type>: <subject> (50 chars max)

<body> (optional, wrap at 72 chars)
- More detailed explanation
- Bullet points for multiple changes
```

Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

### Handling Concurrent Changes
Note: there may be other agents changing the code while you work.
- To minimise interference, chain the unstage/add/commit operations:
  ```bash
  git reset HEAD unwanted-file && git add wanted-file && git commit -m "fix: resolve auth bug"
  ```
- This reduces the window where another agent's changes could interfere

### Important Notes
- If the code is in a partial/broken state, prioritise commits that leave the codebase working
- If you encounter merge conflicts or ANY unexpected issues, stop and ask the user immediately
- When in doubt, ask the user before proceeding
- When adding files with special characters, quote the path: `git add "path/with special chars/file.txt"`
- If you are just making commits in the batches that you think are sensible and there are no deletions, then you don't need to ask me for permission to stage the commits each time. 

## Subagent

Run this in a subagent unless there is a good reason not to. Provide it with lots of context about what we've been doing that will help it to make good decisions and write a good commit message.
